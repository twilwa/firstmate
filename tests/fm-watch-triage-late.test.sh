# --- the wedge threshold reads the crew's own parked-gate state --------------
# Upstream kunchenguid/firstmate#3055: a lane parked at a validation gate that is
# waiting on a HUMAN is correctly quiet, but nothing in the status LINE says so -
# the evidence is the pipeline's gate state, not anything the worker wrote. One
# such lane reached 671 consecutive escalations on a single home. Neither landed
# mitigation covers it: a declared `paused:` does nothing because a live ordinary
# crewmate's absorb class never reads paused, and raising the threshold delays
# genuine wedge detection for every lane equally.
#
# The distinction that makes this safe is between the two gates the crew state
# both reports as `parked`: one owed a HUMAN, and one owed the CREWMATE's own
# answer. Only the first may go quiet - a crewmate that wedges before answering
# its own gate is exactly the failure this ladder exists to catch - so both
# directions are pinned here, and the crewmate direction is written so that a
# consumer which merely searched the verdict for the token would fail it.
# The second half of that evidence - that the human was actually asked and has
# not answered - is pinned in the test below this one.

# --- a wait record that does not carry every field is refused ----------------
# wait_record joins its five fields with US and wedge_defer_wait parses them with
# `IFS=<us> read`, so consecutive delimiters yield genuinely EMPTY fields and no
# field can shift left into another's position. That is what makes the deferral's
# guard able to enforce the whole contract rather than a position-specific slice
# of it: each field the recheck prints must be present, and a record carrying
# more than its four delimiters is refused too, since `read` puts any surplus
# into the final variable. Deferring on a record that is not what it claims is
# what takes the ladder away, so every one of these must fall back to the
# escalation the caller was about to make instead.
# No shipped evidence producer can emit a malformed record, which is precisely
# the invariant under test, so this loads the real bin/fm-watch.sh through its
# own source guard in a child shell (the entry tests/fm-supervision-events.test.sh
# uses) and drives the real wedge_timer_check. The assertion is on the durable
# wake queue the watcher actually wrote.

# One wedge_timer_check round against a malformed record. <evidence-body> is the
# body of a wedge_wait_evidence override, so a case supplies exactly the record
# under test. Publishes the state directory it ran in as MALFORMED_STATE rather

# --- work the captain is already holding: pane churn must not re-alarm -------

# itself lives in the BACKLOG, written there by bin/fm-captain-hold.sh. No line
# predicate can see that record, so both stale alarms - the captain-relevant one
# and the inconclusive one - re-fired on every new pane hash for as long as the
# captain was deciding, which is the 2026-09 loop observed on delivered work
# awaiting their merge word.
# Pinned here, in both directions: while the call stands the first sight still
# alarms, further sights of the SAME call and status-log state are absorbed, and
# a new pane hash after the window's end alarms once more; and the identical
# fixture WITHOUT the hold keeps alarming on every hash, because a bound that
# swallowed an unheld delivery or blocker would be worse than the churn it removes.
#
# The backlog is real rather than a fixture file: bin/fm-captain-hold.sh is the
# only writer of a hold and tasks-axi the only reader, so a hand-written row
# would pin this test's idea of a hold instead of the one the watcher consults.
#
# Cost: every case below drives churn through ONE watcher process rather than
# relaunching per pane change. Watcher startup dominates a round here, and an
# absorbing watcher stays in its poll loop across churn in production anyway, so
# the cheaper shape is also the more faithful one.

# --- quiet pane, worktree still being written: deferred, never wedge-escalated -

# escalations in an afternoon, three of them demanding deep inspection, while it
# was demonstrably writing source, then tests, then documentation. The detector's
# two inputs (pane quietness, run step) cannot see that, so the pane looks frozen.
# Both halves of the contract are asserted on the SAME fixture, because the whole
# point is that only the worktree evidence differs: writing defers, silent
# escalates on the unchanged schedule.
# Every wait below is the file's standard one (wait_poll_cycle for an absorbing
# watcher, a 100-tick wait_for_exit for an escalating one), because the poll these
# tests assert on is the ONE poll that spawns the bounded worktree walk: on a
# loaded runner it outlives a fixed liveness budget, and a round reaped before it
# finished reports a lost deferral instead of the deferral under test.
